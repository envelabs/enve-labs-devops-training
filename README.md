### What is DevOps?

DevOps is not a technology. DevOps is not Development, QA or Operations. There is no perfect definition for DevOps as it is evolving. As per the understanding, **DevOps is a practice, a working culture and a thinking method.**

A DevOps Practitioner / Consultant should have knowledge and experience from development, operations, and the complete software development life cycle. These people/team is responsible for all the activities of software/application, from development to production. They make sure development life cycle goes smooth. Below are some of the concepts or practices which help to maintain DevOps Principles.

### Why DevOps?

As DevOps is more about principles and practices, it improves software delivery and increases business value.

A lot of companies are starting to build DevOps teams. The T-Shaped profiles (eg: Person who has depth knowledge in development and have knowledge also in CI and CD / a person depth knowledge and experience in operations and have knowledge in development) are ideal people for building DevOps Team.

### DevOps Principles

  - Holistic System thinking\
  (En términos generales, **holístico** indica que un sistema y sus propiedades se analizan como un todo, de una manera global e integrada, ya que desde este punto de vista su funcionamiento sólo se puede comprender de esta manera y no sólo como la simple suma de sus partes.

  Holístico se suele aplicar a términos como planteamiento, pensamiento, paradigma, enfoque, concepto o programa para significar que se utiliza una visión integral y completa en el análisis de una realidad)
  - Iterative
  - Collaborative
  - Automated
  - Self-Service
  - Incremental
  - **NO** Silos\
  (an information silo is an insular management system incapable of reciprocal operation with other, related information systems. Information silo occurs whenever a data system is incompatible or not integrated with other data systems)
  - Rapid useful feedback
